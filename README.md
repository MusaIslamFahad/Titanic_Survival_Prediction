# 🚢 Titanic Survival Prediction 🔍 | Machine Learning Classification Project

This project uses machine learning to predict which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck. Leveraging the iconic [Kaggle Titanic dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic), it explores data preprocessing, feature encoding, and classification techniques to model survival outcomes.
